Background:
Monitoring a patient while they are admitted in the ICU plays a major role in determining the progress of their treatment. Most of the data is lost or not recorded correctly due to multiple reasons such as faulty equipment, time of determining each of the tests, etc. This could result in the loss of more data that could depend on these missed values.

Intuition: 
Medical data recorded when a person is admitted in the ICU is motivated by the intuition that it is proportional to the rate at which they are believed to be changed. For example, heart rate can change every minute but blood sugar level might change every four hours.
